### Description

### Global Optimization

Global optimization is encountered in a wide variety of applications including portfolio management, protein structure prediction, engineering design, 
object packing, curve fitting and many more. Unlike local optimization, where one is satisfied with minimizers over a neighbourhood, 
global optimization requires exploration/consideration of the entire feasible domain. This task is commonly associated with large computational costs, 
which often grow exponentially with the dimension of the problem rendering global optimization of high- dimensional functions an extremely challenging problem. 
Along with attempts to devise a generic global optimization algorithm capable of handling high-dimensional problems, 
researchers have also targeted specific classes of functions, which possess some type of structure often encountered in practice. 
The main subclass of problems that are ‘easy’ are convex problems ($f$ is a convex function and $\mathcal{X}$ is a convex set); 
most convex problems of practical importance are solvable in polynomial time and hence tractable [117]. However, real-life problems are often non-convex, 
having multiple local and global extrema, or they are black-box, so that their convexity or lack of, cannot be ascertained a priori.
